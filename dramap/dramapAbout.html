	<h2>What is DraMap?</h2>
	<p>Sometimes you miss out on shows that are right in your neighborhood just because you don't realize they're there! 
		DraMap is here to make figuring out a show to see that is close to you even easier. While it's still very simplistic, 
		we hope to build on this site over time to provide more and more information to you like bus lines, parking, upcoming shows, and easy pricing identifiers. 
		DraMap aspires to be Seattle's leading performance promoter, free for both sides.</p>
	<h2>Who are you?</h2> 
	<p>This site began being constructed by Elex Hill, after she graduated from UW with a Bachelor's in Geography, March 2017. 
		Not long after, she brought her friend Brandon Le onto the project, an aspiring CS major. Shout out to the Cozy Cave
